# Project-FE-Revived
**Welcome!**
This is a project that has been in the makings for a long time by me and my friend Kris!
We'll be posting our scripts right here now and then to show the progress.

**NOTE: This game is heavily inspired by Crazyblox Games's "Flood Escape 2"**
**Revive Productions is NOT associated with Crazyblox or "Flood Escape 2", however are INSPIRED by "Flood Escape 2" and Crazyblox.**

**Changes will be made. This never will be finished.**

This is a attempt to bring back the fun of making maps and playing maps.
**(No, we are not trying to offend you by the opinion of the sentence above)

This project is open source, Your pull requests may be added, or maybe NOT.

**We are accepting contributors.**

**SCRIPTING NOTE FROM KRIS**
**------------------------**
I use PascalCase in my coding, if you do end up getting a PR approved, most of the code will be changed to fit my style, your credit will still be shown though.
